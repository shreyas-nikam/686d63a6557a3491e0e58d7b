# Technical Specification for Jupyter Notebook: EPS Calculator & Dilution Impact

## 1. Notebook Overview

This Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive educational tool to calculate and compare Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Diluted EPS. It allows users to manipulate key financial data and observe the impact of various potentially dilutive securities on EPS calculations, illustrating the principles of the 'if-converted method' and the 'treasury stock method'.

### Learning Goals

Upon completion of this notebook, users will be able to:
- Understand the key insights regarding EPS calculations as presented in financial analysis documents.
- Distinguish between simple and complex capital structures relevant to EPS.
- Calculate Basic EPS, considering weighted average shares outstanding and preferred dividends.
- Apply the 'if-converted method' for convertible preferred stock and convertible debt to determine their impact on Diluted EPS.
- Apply the 'treasury stock method' for stock options and warrants in Diluted EPS calculations.
- Identify and understand the concept of antidilutive securities and their implications for EPS.

### Expected Outcomes

- An interactive environment for inputting financial data.
- Clear, step-by-step calculations of Basic and Diluted EPS.
- Dynamic visualizations comparing EPS under different scenarios and illustrating relationships between inputs and Diluted EPS.
- A deeper understanding of how dilutive securities affect a company's earnings per share.

### Scope & Constraints

- The notebook is designed for end-to-end execution on a mid-spec laptop (8 GB RAM) within five minutes.
- Only open-source Python libraries from PyPI may be used.
- All major computational and analytical steps will include both code comments and brief narrative cells describing *what* is happening and *why*.
- No deployment steps or platform-specific references (e.g., Streamlit) are included.

## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will detail the fundamental formulas and methodologies for EPS calculation, explaining the underlying principles using LaTeX for clarity.

### 2.1 Basic EPS

#### Markdown Explanation
Basic EPS represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding common share. It is calculated by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Preferred dividends, if any, are subtracted from net income to arrive at the income available to common shareholders.

#### Formula (Cell Type: Markdown)
$$Basic\ EPS = \frac{Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding}$$

#### Key Definitions (Cell Type: Markdown)
- **Net income**: The company's total earnings (profit).
- **Preferred dividends**: Dividends paid on preferred stock, which are subtracted from net income before calculating EPS for common shareholders.
- **Weighted average number of shares outstanding**: The number of common shares outstanding during the period, weighted by the portion of the period they were outstanding. This accounts for changes in share count due to issuances or repurchases. For example, if $S_1$ shares are outstanding for $T_1$ months and $S_2$ shares for $T_2$ months, the weighted average is $\frac{(S_1 \times T_1) + (S_2 \times T_2)}{T_1 + T_2}$.

### 2.2 Complex Capital Structures and Diluted EPS

#### Markdown Explanation
A company has a complex capital structure if it has potentially dilutive securities outstanding. These are financial instruments that, if converted or exercised, would increase the number of common shares outstanding and thereby decrease (dilute) the earnings per share. Diluted EPS reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur. By definition, diluted EPS is always less than or equal to basic EPS. Securities that would *increase* EPS if converted are considered antidilutive and are excluded from diluted EPS calculations.

#### Types of Potentially Dilutive Securities (Cell Type: Markdown)
The notebook will focus on three main types of potentially dilutive securities:
1.  **Convertible Preferred Stock**: Preferred shares that can be exchanged for common shares.
2.  **Convertible Debt**: Bonds or other debt instruments that can be converted into common shares.
3.  **Stock Options and Warrants**: Rights to purchase common shares at a specified price.

### 2.3 Diluted EPS: If-Converted Method (Convertible Preferred Stock)

#### Markdown Explanation
The 'if-converted method' for convertible preferred stock assumes that these shares were converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period (or at the time of issuance, if later). This method has two main effects on the EPS calculation:
1.  **Numerator Adjustment**: Preferred dividends on the converted preferred stock are no longer paid, thus increasing the net income available to common shareholders.
2.  **Denominator Adjustment**: The number of common shares outstanding increases due to the conversion.

#### Formula (Cell Type: Markdown)
$$Diluted\ EPS_{Preferred} = \frac{Net\ income}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + New\ common\ shares\ from\ conversion}$$

#### Derivation Insights (Cell Type: Markdown)
The numerator increases because the preferred dividends (which were subtracted for Basic EPS) are no longer paid under the assumption of conversion. The denominator increases by the number of common shares that would be issued upon conversion.

### 2.4 Diluted EPS: If-Converted Method (Convertible Debt)

#### Markdown Explanation
For convertible debt, the 'if-converted method' assumes the debt was converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or issuance date). The impact on EPS is as follows:
1.  **Numerator Adjustment**: The interest expense on the converted debt is eliminated, which increases net income. This interest expense savings is adjusted for taxes.
2.  **Denominator Adjustment**: The number of common shares outstanding increases due to the conversion.

#### Formula (Cell Type: Markdown)
$$Diluted\ EPS_{Debt} = \frac{Net\ income + Interest\ Expense_{Convertible\ Debt} \times (1 - Tax\ Rate) - Preferred\ Dividends_{Non-Convertible}}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + New\ common\ shares\ from\ conversion}$$

#### Derivation Insights (Cell Type: Markdown)
The after-tax interest savings are added back to the net income, as this expense would not have been incurred if the debt had been converted. The denominator increases by the number of common shares issued upon conversion of the debt.

### 2.5 Diluted EPS: Treasury Stock Method (Stock Options & Warrants)

#### Markdown Explanation
The 'treasury stock method' for stock options and warrants assumes that these instruments are exercised at the beginning of the period (or issuance date). The proceeds received from the exercise are then assumed to be used by the company to repurchase its own common stock at the average market price during the period.
1.  **Numerator Adjustment**: No change to net income, as option exercise does not directly impact the company's earnings.
2.  **Denominator Adjustment**: The increase in shares is the difference between shares issued upon exercise and shares repurchased with the hypothetical proceeds.

#### Formulas for Incremental Shares (Cell Type: Markdown)
- Proceeds from exercise:
  $P = N_{options} \times E_p$
  where $N_{options}$ is the number of options and $E_p$ is the exercise price.

- Shares repurchased:
  $S_{repurchased} = \frac{P}{M_p}$
  where $M_p$ is the average market price of the common stock.

- Incremental shares added to denominator:
  $S_{incremental} = N_{options} - S_{repurchased}$

- The diluted EPS formula (using only options/warrants in a simple structure for illustration):
  $$Diluted\ EPS_{Options} = \frac{Net\ income - Preferred\ dividends}{Weighted\ average\ number\ of\ shares\ outstanding + S_{incremental}}$$

#### Antidilutive Consideration (Cell Type: Markdown)
A security is considered antidilutive if its assumed conversion or exercise would result in an EPS higher than Basic EPS. Antidilutive securities are *excluded* from the Diluted EPS calculation to ensure that Diluted EPS always represents the maximum potential dilution. This typically occurs for options/warrants when the exercise price is greater than the average market price.

## 3. Code Requirements

This section outlines the structure and content for the executable code cells within the Jupyter Notebook.

### 3.1 Setup and Data Generation

#### Code Section: Import Libraries (Cell Type: Code)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
```
*Narrative: Imports all necessary libraries for data handling, numerical operations, plotting, and interactive widgets. Python's `ipywidgets` library will be used for interactive user inputs.*

#### Code Section: Synthetic Data Generation (Cell Type: Code)
```python
# Function to generate synthetic financial data
def generate_synthetic_data(num_records=1):
    data = {
        'Net Income': np.random.uniform(50_000_000, 500_000_000, num_records),
        'Preferred Dividends': np.random.uniform(1_000_000, 10_000_000, num_records),
        'Weighted Average Shares Outstanding': np.random.uniform(10_000_000, 100_000_000, num_records),
        'Tax Rate': np.random.uniform(0.15, 0.35, num_records),
        'Convertible Preferred Stock Count': np.random.randint(100_000, 1_000_000, num_records),
        'Convertible Preferred Conversion Ratio': np.random.uniform(1.5, 5.0, num_records),
        'Convertible Preferred Dividend Per Share': np.random.uniform(0.5, 2.0, num_records),
        'Convertible Debt Face Value': np.random.uniform(10_000_000, 50_000_000, num_records),
        'Convertible Debt Coupon Rate': np.random.uniform(0.02, 0.08, num_records),
        'Convertible Debt Conversion Ratio (Shares per $1000)': np.random.uniform(10, 50, num_records),
        'Stock Option Count': np.random.randint(500_000, 5_000_000, num_records),
        'Stock Option Exercise Price': np.random.uniform(10, 50, num_records),
        'Average Market Price': np.random.uniform(20, 100, num_records)
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Ensure average market price is generally above exercise price for dilutive effect on options
    df['Average Market Price'] = df.apply(lambda row: max(row['Average Market Price'], row['Stock Option Exercise Price'] * 1.1), axis=1)
    # Ensure preferred dividends are always less than net income
    df['Preferred Dividends'] = df.apply(lambda row: min(row['Preferred Dividends'], row['Net Income'] * 0.1), axis=1)

    # Convert specific columns to appropriate integer types where applicable
    int_cols = ['Convertible Preferred Stock Count', 'Stock Option Count']
    for col in int_cols:
        df[col] = df[col].astype(int)

    return df.iloc[0] # Return a single row (Series) for simplicity in interactive form

# Generate sample data for initial run
sample_data = generate_synthetic_data()

# Data validation (confirm expected column names, data types, no missing values in critical fields)
# This will be done programmatically in a dedicated cell or within calculation functions for robustness.
# For simplicity, we assume the generated synthetic data adheres to the expected format.
```
*Narrative: This function creates a synthetic dataset containing realistic financial figures required for EPS calculations. It ensures that the notebook can run out-of-the-box even without user-provided data. Data types and basic value constraints (e.g., Average Market Price > Exercise Price) are enforced for logical consistency. For a more robust notebook, explicit data validation and error handling would be implemented.*

*Narrative: This cell contains the core logic for calculating Basic and Diluted EPS, incorporating the 'if-converted' and 'treasury stock' methods. It includes explicit checks for antidilutive securities, ensuring that Diluted EPS is never greater than Basic EPS. The `orchestrate_eps_calculation` function acts as the central logic unit, correctly applying the anti-dilution principle for each security type against the prevailing EPS before considering that security. The `update_eps_display` function is an interactive callback that re-calculates EPS and updates the visualizations whenever user inputs change.*

### 3.4 Visualization

#### Code Section: Visualization Generation (Integrated into `update_eps_display` function above)
*Narrative: The `update_eps_display` function dynamically generates two types of plots: an aggregated comparison bar chart (Basic vs. Diluted EPS) and a relationship plot (Diluted EPS vs. Average Market Price for options, showing sensitivity). Plotly is chosen for interactivity, providing hover-tooltips, zoom, and pan functionalities. Visuals are designed with a color-blind friendly palette and a minimum font size of 12pt for readability. Titles, axis labels, and legends are automatically generated. A commented-out section shows how to save static PNG images for offline use.*

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

### 4.1 Assumptions and Constraints

-   **Data Inputs**: Users are assumed to provide valid numeric inputs for all financial parameters. Default synthetic data is provided for immediate execution.
-   **Tax Rate**: A single corporate tax rate is applied to all interest expense adjustments.
-   **No Prior Period Adjustments**: The calculations are for a single reporting period; no historical data adjustments for stock splits or dividends are explicitly handled beyond the weighted average shares outstanding concept.
-   **Conversion Timing**: All conversions/exercises of dilutive securities are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period for simplicity, as per standard diluted EPS calculation methodologies for a full year.
-   **Open Source Libraries**: Strictly adheres to Python's open-source PyPI libraries.
-   **Performance**: Optimized for execution within 5 minutes on a mid-spec laptop.

### 4.2 Customization Instructions

Users can customize the analysis by:
-   Adjusting the numeric values via sliders and text input fields in the "User Input Forms" section.
-   Exploring the impact of different security types by changing their respective parameters. For example, setting the 'Convertible Preferred Stock Count' to 0 will effectively remove its impact.
-   The interactive plots allow for exploration of relationships, such as how changes in 'Average Market Price' affect diluted EPS for stock options.

### 4.3 Narrative Cells & Code Comments

-   Each major step and logical block in the code will be preceded by a brief narrative Markdown cell explaining *what* the code does and *why* it's being done.
-   In-line comments will be used within code cells to clarify specific lines or complex logic.
